- works in environments like Pluto, VS Code, quarto publish
- easy!


Collect a calendar week: the result is a Vector of `LiturgicalDay`s.

```{julia}
#| warning: false
using Lectionary
wk = calendar_week()
```


Format a Markdown table with a column for each day:

```{julia}
#| output: false
mdlines = [
    "| Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday |",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---  |"
]
oneweek = []
for litday in wk
    if isnothing(litday)
        push!(oneweek," ")
    else
        push!(oneweek, string(litday))
    end
end
wkstring = "| " * join(oneweek, " | ") * " |"
push!(mdlines, wkstring)
```

In an environment like Pluto, VS Code, or with quarto publish, we can use the `Markdown` package's `parse` function to create displayable output:

```{julia}
#| asis: true
using Markdown
join(mdlines,"\n") * "\n" |> Markdown.parse
```
