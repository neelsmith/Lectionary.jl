## Liturgical days with multiple services

RCL lists separate readings for multiple services on:

- Christmas Day: three propers of Christmas Day (Proper 1, Proper 2, Proper 3)
- Palm Sunday: Liturgy of the Palms, Liturgy of the Word
- Easter Day: Great Vigil, Early Service, Principal Service, Evening Service

Readings for specific services on these days can be specified with the `service` parameter.

```{julia}
xmas = Commemoration(Lectionary.FEAST_CHRISTMAS, LiturgicalYear(2023))
