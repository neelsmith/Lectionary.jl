## The `LiturgicalYear`

The *liturgical year* is modelled by the `LiturgicalYear` type, a central structure in `Lectionary.jl`. You can create a `LiturgicalYear` from a  `Date` object as a single parameter, or with no parameter with the date value defaulting to today, or with an integer value for the calendar year in which Advent of the liturgical year begins, as this example illustrates:


```{julia}
#| warning: false
using Lectionary
lityear = LiturgicalYear(2023)
```

Things you can find out about a liturgical year include:


-  its place in the three-year cycle of the Revised Commmon Lectionary (identified by one of the characters 'A', 'B' or 'C'):

```{julia}
lectionary_year(lityear)
```

- its sequence in the Episcopal Church's two-year cycle of Daily Office Readings (identified by an integer value, 1 or 2):

```{julia}
daily_office_year(lityear)
```


- the range of its dates (from Advent 1 to the end of the liturgical year) in the civil calendar:

```{julia}
date_range(lityear)
```

The result is a range of `Date`s (from the `Dates` package). Of course you can collect them, like any other range value in Julia. Here we can see that the 2023-2024 liturgical year spans 364 days in the civil calendar.

```{julia}
date_range(lityear) |> collect |> length
```

## The `LiturgicalDay`

The `LiturgicalDay` is an abstract type with concrete implementations:

- `Feast`: feasts of the liturgical year other than Sundays. (The movable feasts could coincide with a Sunday.)
- `Sunday`:  the Sundays of the liturgical year
- `OtherDay`: 

All liturgical days with readings assigned in the RCL:

```{julia}
kalendar(lityear)
```


Any date in the civil calendar can be mapped to a `LiturgicalDay`.


You can find types of days for a liturgical year.



```{julia}
holy_days(lityear)
```


Any day in the civil calendar  can be mapped to a liturgical day.


## Seasons of the year

Numerous functions let you find the holy days belonging to a season of the liturgical year.
