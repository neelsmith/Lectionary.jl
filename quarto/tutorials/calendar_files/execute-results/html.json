You can create a `LiturgicalYear` from a  `Date` object as a single parameter; if you construct a `LiturgicalYear` with no parameter, the date value defaults to today. You can also construct a `LiturgicalYear` with an integer value for the calendar year in which the liturgical year begins (i.e., the year of the civil calendar that Advent falls in).\n\n::: {#a007df55 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nusing Lectionary\nlityear = LiturgicalYear(2023)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=11}\n```\n2023-2024\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Basic facts of the liturgical year\n\nThings you can find out about a liturgical year include:\n\n\n-  its place in the three-year cycle of the Revised Commmon Lectionary (identified by one of the characters 'A', 'B' or 'C'):\n\n::: {#a7ef2ea8 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nlectionary_year(lityear)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=12}\n```\n'B': ASCII/Unicode U+0042 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- its sequence in the Episcopal Church's two-year cycle of Daily Office Readings (identified by an integer value, 1 or 2):\n\n::: {#3d1359da .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ndaily_office_year(lityear)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=13}\n```\n2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- the range of its dates (from Advent 1 to the end of the liturgical year) in the civil calendar:\n\n::: {#d8b4bf0b .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ndate_range(lityear)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=14}\n```\nDates.Date(\"2023-12-03\"):Dates.Day(1):Dates.Date(\"2024-11-30\")\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe result is a range of `Date`s (from the `Dates` package). Of course you can collect them, like any other range value in Julia. Here we can see that the 2023-2024 liturgical year spans 364 days in the civil calendar.\n\n::: {#a69f4e97 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ndate_range(lityear) |> collect |> length\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=15}\n```\n364\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- a full calendar of dates with assigned readings in the RCL (all Sundays and feast days):\n\n::: {#5589db7e .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nkalendar(lityear)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=16}\n```\n89-element Vector{LiturgicalDay}:\n the first Sunday of Advent, December 3, 2023\n the second Sunday of Advent, December 10, 2023\n the third Sunday of Advent, December 17, 2023\n Saint Thomas the Apostle, December 21, 2023\n the fourth Sunday of Advent, December 24, 2023\n Christmas Day, December 25, 2023\n Saint Stephen, December 26, 2023\n Saint John Apostle and Evangelist, December 27, 2023\n The Holy Innocents, December 28, 2023\n the first Sunday after Christmas Day, December 31, 2023\n The Holy Name, January 1, 2024\n The Epiphany, January 6, 2024\n the Epiphany, January 7, 2024\n ⋮\n Saint Luke the Evangelist, October 18, 2024\n the twenty-second Sunday after Pentecost, October 20, 2024\n Saint James of Jersualem, October 23, 2024\n the twenty-third Sunday after Pentecost, October 27, 2024\n Saint Simon and Saint Jude, Apostles, October 28, 2024\n All Saints' Day, November 1, 2024\n the twenty-fourth Sunday after Pentecost, November 3, 2024\n the twenty-fifth Sunday after Pentecost, November 10, 2024\n the twenty-sixth Sunday after Pentecost, November 17, 2024\n the twenty-seventh Sunday after Pentecost, November 24, 2024\n Thanksgiving Day, November 28, 2024\n Saint Andrew the Apostle, November 30, 2024\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The `LiturgicalDay`\n\nThe `LiturgicalDay` is an abstract type with concrete implementations:\n\n- `Feast`: feasts of the liturgical year other than Sundays.
