## Current status

`Lectionary.jl` has not yet been registered on juliahub.  To work with the current pre-release version, you can add the package from the github repository at [https://github.com/neelsmith/Lectionary.jl](https://github.com/neelsmith/Lectionary.jl).  To follow the progress towards an initial release, you can see [this milestone](https://github.com/neelsmith/Lectionary.jl/milestone/1) on the project issue tracker.


The initial public release will include complete RCL readings for Year B.  Subsequent releases will add readings for Years A and C.
