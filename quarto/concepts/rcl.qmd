## Overview

A *lectionary* is a collection of Biblical readings arranged according to the calendar of [the liturgical year](./liturgicalyear/). The *Revised Common Lectionary*, or  *RCL*, is a product of two groups, the North American Consultation on Common Texts (CCT) and, later, the International English Language Liturgical Consultation (ELLC). Their work is documented online the [Consultation on Common Texts website](https://www.commontexts.org/rcl/).

The readings in the RCL are organized in a three-year cycle. The years in the cycle are identified as Year A, B or C. The cycle begins with Year A in years when the calendar year of the first Sunday of Advent is evenly divisible by three. The liturgical year 2022-2023, for example, was Year A because 2022 is evenly divisible by three (or, phrased differently, 2022 modulo 3 is 0).

## Content of readings for a given liturgy


The RCL lists four readings for each liturgy it includes. Most often, the first reading is taken from the Old Testament and the second reading from the New Testament, along with a reading from the Gospels and a reading from the Psalms. (The Easter Vigil is an exception to this rule.)

Three days in the liturgical calendar of the RCL have readings for more than one service: Christmas Day, Palm Sunday and Easter Day.
